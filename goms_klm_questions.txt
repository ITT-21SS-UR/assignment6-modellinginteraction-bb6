a) What does the term "critical path" describe with regard to GOMS?




b) Why might the original KLM not perfectly model input performance on a laptop? How could it be adapted?

The difference with a laptop is that a trackpad instead of a mouse is used. This can change
the estimated KLM values. A Trackpad is much closer to the keyboard than a mouse which is 
usually placed on the left or right side to the keyboard. With a laptop it is possible to 
use the trackpad with your thumbs and simultaneously writing on the keyboard without having 
to move from the trackpad. To adapt the KLM to a laptop, it would be neccesary to conduct 
an additional study to estimate the KLM values.
