Question as answered by Kay Brinkmann, Question B answered by Joshua Benker

a) What does the term "critical path" describe with regard to GOMS?

The "critical path method" is used for calculating task times for complex tasks that contain multiple,
parallel activities. The "critical path" has a similar meaning as used in project management, and as such
described the sequence of activities in a task which takes the longest time out of all sequences.
Calculating/ measuring the time it takes to complete this sequence can be used as the task time
of the entire task.

b) Why might the original KLM not perfectly model input performance on a laptop? How could it be adapted?

The difference with a laptop is that a trackpad instead of a mouse is used. This can change
the estimated KLM values. A Trackpad is much closer to the keyboard than a mouse which is 
usually placed on the left or right side to the keyboard. With a laptop it is possible to 
use the trackpad with your thumbs and simultaneously writing on the keyboard without having 
to move from the trackpad. To adapt the KLM to a laptop, it would be neccesary to conduct 
an additional study to estimate the KLM values.
